# Azure IoT EdgeHub Dev Tool [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Azure/iotedgehubdev.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Azure/iotedgehubdev)
The Azure IoT EdgeHub Dev Tool provide a local development experience with a simulator for creating, developing, testing, running, and debugging Azure IoT Edge modules and solutions.
- The bits/code of Edge module running on simulator and IoT Edge Runtime are **same**.
- The Edge solution could be run with the simulator locally without **pushing image** and **creating IoT Edge deployment**.
- The credential needed to run Edge solution on simulator is IoT Edge Device Connectionstring. And IoT Hub Connectionstring is not needed.
- It helps to debug the module on the host (not in container) with the EdgeHub

The following table compares the steps needed to run the solution on the IoT Edge Runtime and iotedgehubdev tool.

  |                     | IoT Edge Runtime | iotedgehubdev |
  | ------------------- |:----------------------------:|:-------------:|
  | Device Credential Needed | YES | YES |
  | IoT Hub Credential Needed | YES | **NO** |
  | Build Image | YES | YES |
  | Push Image | YES | **NO** |
  | Create Deployment | YES | **NO** |
  | Support native debug scenario| No | **YES** |

## Installing
1. Install [Docker CE (18.02.0+)](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) on
[Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/), [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce).

2. Install [Docker Compose (1.20.0+)](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) (Only required for **Linux**. Compose has already been included in Windows/macOS Docker CE installation)
3. Install [Python (2.7/3.5+) and Pip](https://www.python.org/)
4. Install iotedgehubdev by running below command in your terminal
    ```
    pip install --upgrade iotedgehubdev
    ```
    **Note**: Please install iotedgehubdev to **root** on Linux/macOS (*Don't use '--user' option in the 'pip install' command*).

**Please make sure there is no Azure IoT Edge runtime running on the same machine with iotedgehubdev since they require the same ports.**

## Quickstart
1. Setup
    ```
    iotedgehubdev setup -c <edge-device-connection-string>
    ```

2. Start/stop an IoT Edge solution in simulator
    ```
    iotedgehubdev start -d <path/to/deployment manifest>
    iotedgehubdev stop
    ```

3. Start and debug a single module natively
    1. Start the module with specific input(s)
        ```
        iotedgehubdev start -i <module-inputs>
        ```

        For example: `iotedgehubdev start -i "input1,input2"`
    
    2. Output the module credential environment variables

        ```
        iotedgehubdev modulecred
        ```

    3. Start the module natively with the environment variables got from previous step
    4. Send message to the module through RESTful API. 

        For example:
        `curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"inputName": "input1","data": "hello world"}' http://localhost:53000/api/v1/messages`
